# GoogleNearbySearch.py
Author: Manuel Jorge
A place searching script, using Google API for nearby places, set your api Key on credenciais_google.py, Google api itself has a daily limit of requests (1 per day, idk why), but it works pretty well, once you setted your api key, you just need to run the program and follow the instructions.
